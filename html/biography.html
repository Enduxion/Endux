            Hey!<br />
            I'm Pawan Gurung, currently studying in grade 11 at Shree
            Vindhyavasini Secondary School in Pokhara City. My fervent interest
            in programming and mathematics is reflected in my expertise across
            multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Despite being self-taught in both
            programming and calculus, I take great pride in my ability to
            continuously learn and expand my skill set.

            Apart from my academic pursuits, I'm passionate about graphic
            designing, electrical and mechanical studies, human psychology, and
            the game of chess which I often play during my leisure time. In
            summary, I'm a curious and enthusiastic learner who constantly seeks
            out opportunities to broaden my knowledge and skills.

            I completed my SEE with a 3.60 GPA from Shree Vindhyavasini
            Secondary School, where I am currently studying in grade 11. Prior
            to that, I studied up until grade 8 at Pragati Secondary School
            before transferring to my current school for further education. As a
            self-taught calculus student, I've completed Calculus 1, 2, and 3,
            as it's an area of particular interest to me.

            I began my programming journey in 2020 with C++ as my first language
            and quickly learned to work with the SFML library, where I developed
            several games, including chess. I also worked on other small
            projects, including a projectile motion model and a simple physics
            engine with SFML, which furthered my programming knowledge. After
            investing significant time in C++, I expanded my skillset with Java,
            Python, Javascript, and PHP. Currently, I'm focused on building a
            chess engine using the alpha-beta pruning method. However, due to my
            academic commitments, I'm unable to devote as much time to
            programming as I would like. You can download my projects from
